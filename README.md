This repository includes the codes used for the paper "Shared mental states across wake and sleep"

- OA_clustering_analyses: analyses used to cluster mental experiences based on participants' scores along the 4 dimensions. The code also includes EEG analyses used to describe the 4 clusters

- OA_eeg_preprocessing: preprocessing pipeline for EEG data
  
- OA_eeg_feature_computation: feature extraction pipeline (spectral, complexity, connectivity) for EEG data

- OA_main_effects.py: analyses aiming at examining global effects of Mental State on EEG irrespective of spatial distribution, averaging EEG values across channels.

- OA_topo_contrasts.py: Pairwise mental state comparisons to assess the direction of the observed effects
